      "multinational firms. Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and it is\n",
      "on these that we base this book.\n",
      "We wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating sys-\n",
      "tems at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate\n",
      "level. We hope that practitioners will also find it useful. It provides a clear\n",
      "description of the concepts that underlie operating systems. As prerequisites,\n",
      "we assume that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer\n",
      "organization, and a high-level language, such as C or Java. The hardware topics\n",
      "required for an understanding of operating systems are covered in Chapter 1.\n",
      "In that chapter, we also include an overview of the fundamental data structures\n",
      "that are prevalent in most operating systems. For code examples, we use pre-\n",
      "dominantly C, as well as a significant amount of Java, but the reader can still\n",
      "understand the algorithms without a thorough knowledge of these languages.\n",
      "Concepts are presented using intuitive descriptions. Important theoretical\n",
      "results are covered, but formal proofs are largely omitted. The bibliographical\n",
      "notes at the end of each chapter contain pointers to research papers in which\n",
      "results were first presented and proved, as well as references to recent material\n",
      "for further reading. In place of proofs, figures and examples are used to suggest\n",
      "why we should expect the result in question to be true.\n",
      "The fundamental concepts and algorithms covered in the book are often\n",
      "based on those used in both open-source and commercial operating systems.\n",
      "Our aim is to present these concepts and algorithms in a general setting that\n",
      "is not tied to one particular operating system. However, we present a large\n",
      "number of examples that pertain to the most popular and the most innovative\n",

      "Content of This Book\n",
      "The text is organized in ten major parts:\n",
      "• Overview. Chapters 1 and 2 explain what operating systems are, what\n",
      "they do, and how they are designed and constructed. These chapters dis-\n",
      "cuss what the common features of an operating system are and what an\n",
      "operating system does for the user. We include coverage of both tradi-\n",
      "tional PC and server operating systems and operating systems for mobile\n",
      "devices. The presentation is motivational and explanatory in nature. We\n",
      "have avoided a discussion of how things are done internally in these chap-\n",
      "ters. Therefore, they are suitable for individual readers or for students in\n",
      "lower-level classes who want to learn what an operating system is without\n",
      "getting into the details of the internal algorithms.\n",
      "• Process management. Chapters 3 through 5 describe the process concept\n",
      "and concurrency as the heart of modern operating systems. A process is\n",
      "the unit of work in a system. Such a system consists of a collection of\n",
      "concurrently executing processes, some executing operating-system code\n",
      "and others executing user code. These chapters cover methods for process\n",
      "scheduling and interprocess communication. Also included is a detailed\n",
      "discussion of threads, as well as an examination of issues related to multi-\n",
      "core systems and parallel programming.\n",
      "• Process synchronization. Chapters 6 through 8 cover methods for process\n",
      "synchronization and deadlock handling. Because we have increased the\n",
      "coverage of process synchronization, we have divided the former Chapter\n",
      "5 (Process Synchronization) into two separate chapters: Chapter 6, Syn-\n",
      "chronization Tools, and Chapter 7, Synchronization Examples.\n",
      "• Memory management. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with the management of\n",
      "main memory during the execution of a process. To improve both the\n",
      "x\n",
      "Preface\n",
      "utilization of the CPU and the speed of its response to its users, the com-\n",
      "puter must keep several processes in memory. There are many different\n",
      "memory-management schemes, reflecting various approaches to memory\n",
      "management, and the effectiveness of a particular algorithm depends on\n",
      "the situation.\n",
      "• Storage management. Chapters 11 and 12 describe how mass storage and\n",
      "I/O are handled in a modern computer system. The I/O devices that attach\n",
      "to a computer vary widely, and the operating system needs to provide a\n",
      "wide range of functionality to applications to allow them to control all\n",
      "aspects of these devices. We discuss system I/O in depth, including I/O\n",
      "system design, interfaces, and internal system structures and functions.\n",
      "In many ways, I/O devices are the slowest major components of the com-\n",
      "puter. Because they represent a performance bottleneck, we also examine\n",
      "performance issues associated with I/O devices.\n",
      "• File systems. Chapters 13 through 15 discuss how file systems are handled\n",
      "in a modern computer system. File systems provide the mechanism for on-\n",
      "line storage of and access to both data and programs. We describe the clas-\n",
      "sic internal algorithms and structures of storage management and provide\n",
      "a firm practical understanding of the algorithms used—their properties,\n",
      "advantages, and disadvantages.\n",
      "• Security and protection. Chapters 16 and 17 discuss the mechanisms nec-\n",
      "essary for the security and protection of computer systems. The processes\n",
      "in an operating system must be protected from one another’s activities.\n",
      "To provide such protection, we must ensure that only processes that have\n",
      "gained proper authorization from the operating system can operate on\n",
      "the files, memory, CPU, and other resources of the system. Protection is\n",
      "a mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users\n",
      "to computer-system resources. This mechanism must provide a means\n",
      "of specifying the controls to be imposed, as well as a means of enforce-\n",
      "ment. Security protects the integrity of the information stored in the system\n",
      "(both data and code), as well as the physical resources of the system, from\n",
      "unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental\n",
      "introduction of inconsistency.\n",
      "• Advanced topics. Chapters 18 and 19 discuss virtual machines and\n",

      "Linux and macOS are examples of POSIX-compliant systems. POSIX also\n",
      "defines several extensions to the standards, including real-time extensions\n",
      "(POSIX.1b) and an extension for a threads library (POSIX.1c, better known\n",
      "as Pthreads). We provide several programming examples written in C\n",
      "illustrating the POSIX base API, as well as Pthreads and the extensions for\n",
      "real-time programming. These example programs were tested on Linux 4.4\n",

      "We supply a modest number of C programs illustrating the use of this API.\n",

      "To emphasize these topics, we have integrated relevant coverage throughout\n",
      "this new edition. For example, we have greatly increased our coverage of the\n",
      "Android and iOS mobile operating systems, as well as our coverage of the\n",
      "ARMv8 architecture that dominates mobile devices. We have also increased\n",
      "our coverage of multicore systems, including increased coverage of APIs that\n",

      "discuss I/O, mass storage, and file systems.\n",
      "Several of our readers have expressed support for an increase in Java\n",

      "An operating system is software that manages a computer’s hardware. It\n",
      "also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary\n",
      "between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect\n",
      "of operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks in a wide\n",
      "variety of computing environments. Operating systems are everywhere, from\n",
      "cars and home appliances that include “Internet of Things” devices, to smart\n",
      "phones, personal computers, enterprise computers, and cloud computing envi-\n",
      "ronments.\n",
      "In order to explore the role of an operating system in a modern computing\n",
      "environment, it is important first to understand the organization and architec-\n",
      "ture of computer hardware. This includes the CPU, memory, and I/O devices,\n",
      "as well as storage. A fundamental responsibility of an operating system is to\n",
      "allocate these resources to programs.\n",
      "Because an operating system is large and complex, it must be created\n",
      "piece by piece. Each of these pieces should be a well-delineated portion of the\n",
      "system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions. In this chapter,\n",
      "we provide a general overview of the major components of a contemporary\n",
      "computer system as well as the functions provided by the operating system.\n",
      "Additionally, we cover several topics to help set the stage for the remainder of\n",
      "the text: data structures used in operating systems, computing environments,\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "1.1\n",
      "What Operating Systems Do\n",
      "We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the\n",
      "overall computer system. A computer system can be divided roughly into four\n",
      "components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs,\n",
      "and a user (Figure 1.1).\n",
      "The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the\n",
      "input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the\n",
      "system. The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets,\n",
      "compilers, and web browsers—define the ways in which these resources are\n",
      "used to solve users’ computing problems. The operating system controls the\n",
      "hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for\n",
      "the various users.\n",
      "We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software,\n",
      "and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these\n",
      "resources in the operation of the computer system. An operating system is\n",
      "similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function\n",
      "by itself. It simply provides an environment within which other programs can\n",
      "do useful work.\n",
      "To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore\n",
      "operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.\n",
      "1.1.1\n",
      "User View\n",
      "The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used.\n",
      "Many computer users sit with a laptop or in front of a PC consisting of a\n",
      "monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Such a system is designed for one user to\n",
      "monopolize its resources. The goal is to maximize the work (or play) that the\n",
      "user is performing. In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for\n",
      "ease of use, with some attention paid to performance and security and none\n",
      "paid to resource utilization—how various hardware and software resources\n",
      "are shared.\n",
      "(compilers, web browsers, development kits, etc.)\n",
      "user\n",
      "application programs\n",
      "operating system\n",

      "5\n",
      "Increasingly, many users interact with mobile devices such as smartphones\n",
      "and tablets—devices that are replacing desktop and laptop computer systems\n",
      "for some users. These devices are typically connected to networks through\n",
      "cellular or other wireless technologies. The user interface for mobile computers\n",
      "generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by\n",
      "pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical\n",
      "keyboard and mouse. Many mobile devices also allow users to interact through\n",
      "a voice recognition interface, such as Apple’s Siri.\n",
      "Some computers have little or no user view. For example, embedded com-\n",
      "puters in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads and may\n",
      "turn indicator lights on or off to show status, but they and their operating sys-\n",
      "tems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.\n",
      "1.1.2\n",
      "System View\n",
      "From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program most\n",
      "intimately involved with the hardware. In this context, we can view an oper-\n",
      "ating system as a resource allocator. A computer system has many resources\n",
      "that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, storage\n",
      "space, I/O devices, and so on. The operating system acts as the manager of these\n",
      "resources. Facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, the\n",
      "operating system must decide how to allocate them to specific programs and\n",
      "users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.\n",
      "A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to\n",
      "control the various I/O devices and user programs. An operating system is a\n",
      "control program. A control program manages the execution of user programs\n",
      "to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned\n",
      "with the operation and control of I/O devices.\n",
      "1.1.3\n",
      "Deﬁning Operating Systems\n",
      "By now, you can probably see that the term operating system covers many\n",
      "roles and functions. That is the case, at least in part, because of the myriad\n",
      "designs and uses of computers. Computers are present within toasters, cars,\n",
      "ships, spacecraft, homes, and businesses. They are the basis for game machines,\n",
      "cable TV tuners, and industrial control systems.\n",
      "To explain this diversity, we can turn to the history of computers. Although\n",
      "computers have a relatively short history, they have evolved rapidly. Comput-\n",
      "ing started as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly\n",
      "moved to fixed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and\n",
      "trajectory plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation. Those\n",
      "early computers evolved into general-purpose, multifunction mainframes, and\n",
      "that’s when operating systems were born. In the 1960s, Moore’s Law predicted\n",
      "that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every 18\n",
      "months, and that prediction has held true. Computers gained in functionality\n",
      "and shrank in size, leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and\n",
      "variety of operating systems. (See Appendix A for more details on the history\n",
      "of operating systems.)\n",
      "How, then, can we define what an operating system is? In general, we have\n",
      "no completely adequate definition of an operating system. Operating systems\n",
      "6\n",
      "Chapter 1\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "exist because they offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating\n",
      "a usable computing system. The fundamental goal of computer systems is\n",
      "to execute programs and to make solving user problems easier. Computer\n",
      "hardware is constructed toward this goal. Since bare hardware alone is not\n",
      "particularly easy to use, application programs are developed. These programs\n",
      "require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices.\n",
      "The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought\n",
      "together into one piece of software: the operating system.\n",
      "In addition, we have no universally accepted definition of what is part of\n",
      "the operating system. A simple viewpoint is that it includes everything a ven-\n",
      "dor ships when you order “the operating system.” The features included, how-\n",
      "ever, vary greatly across systems. Some systems take up less than a megabyte\n",
      "of space and lack even a full-screen editor, whereas others require gigabytes\n",
      "of space and are based entirely on graphical windowing systems. A more com-\n",
      "mon definition, and the one that we usually follow, is that the operating system\n",
      "is the one program running at all times on the computer—usually called the\n",
      "kernel. Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs: system\n",
      "programs, which are associated with the operating system but are not neces-\n",
      "sarily part of the kernel, and application programs, which include all programs\n",
      "not associated with the operation of the system.\n",
      "The matter of what constitutes an operating system became increasingly\n",
      "important as personal computers became more widespread and operating sys-\n",
      "tems grew increasingly sophisticated. In 1998, the United States Department of\n",
      "Justice filed suit against Microsoft, in essence claiming that Microsoft included\n",
      "too much functionality in its operating systems and thus prevented application\n",
      "vendors from competing. (For example, a web browser was an integral part of\n",
      "Microsoft’s operating systems.) As a result, Microsoft was found guilty of using\n",
      "its operating-system monopoly to limit competition.\n",
      "Today, however, if we look at operating systems for mobile devices, we\n",
      "see that once again the number of features constituting the operating system\n",
      "is increasing. Mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernel\n",
      "but also middleware—a set of software frameworks that provide additional\n",
      "services to application developers. For example, each of the two most promi-\n",
      "nent mobile operating systems—Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android—features\n",
      "WHY STUDY OPERATING SYSTEMS?\n",
      "Although there are many practitioners of computer science, only a small per-\n",
      "centage of them will be involved in the creation or modification of an operat-\n",
      "ing system. Why, then, study operating systems and how they work? Simply\n",
      "because, as almost all code runs on top of an operating system, knowledge\n",
      "of how operating systems work is crucial to proper, efficient, effective, and\n",
      "secure programming. Understanding the fundamentals of operating systems,\n",
      "how they drive computer hardware, and what they provide to applications is\n",
      "not only essential to those who program them but also highly useful to those\n",
      "who write programs on them and use them.\n",

      "7\n",
      "a core kernel along with middleware that supports databases, multimedia, and\n",
      "graphics (to name only a few).\n",
      "In summary, for our purposes, the operating system includes the always-\n",
      "running kernel, middleware frameworks that ease application development\n",
      "and provide features, and system programs that aid in managing the system\n",
      "while it is running. Most of this text is concerned with the kernel of general-\n",
      "purpose operating systems, but other components are discussed as needed to\n",
      "fully explain operating system design and operation.\n",
      "1.2\n",
      "Computer-System Organization\n",
      "A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and\n",
      "a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides\n",
      "access between components and shared memory (Figure 1.2). Each device\n",
      "controller is in charge of a specific type of device (for example, a disk drive,\n",
      "audio device, or graphics display). Depending on the controller, more than one\n",
      "device may be attached. For instance, one system USB port can connect to a\n",
      "USB hub, to which several devices can connect. A device controller maintains\n",
      "some local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers. The device\n",
      "controller is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices\n",
      "that it controls and its local buffer storage.\n",
      "Typically, operating systems have a device driver for each device con-\n",
      "troller. This device driver understands the device controller and provides the\n",
      "rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device. The CPU and\n",
      "the device controllers can execute in parallel, competing for memory cycles. To\n",
      "ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes\n",
      "access to the memory.\n",
      "In the following subsections, we describe some basics of how such a system\n",
      "operates, focusing on three key aspects of the system. We start with interrupts,\n",
